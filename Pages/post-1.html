            <h1>Migrating to GitHub actions for Rails CI</h1>

            <p>For the last couple of years I’ve been using Ruby.ci to power CI checks on my rails applications. RubyCI
                is one of those amazing tools that was zero effort to setup and ran flawlessly, it was exactly how I
                feel that DevOps should be. Sadly, Alex has decided to retire the project and move onto other things.
                <br><br>

                RubyCI is shutting down on October 15th. Alex gave all users a month’s notice to migrate away to another
                CI tool, his suggestion was to go with Circle CI, but I decided on GitHub actions. I like the idea of
                running your CI checks close to your code. GitHub actions are well documented, backed by a strong
                community and has a well implemented marketplace. Which, after the initial configuration, does make
                setting things up quite a bit easier.
                <br><br>

                GitHub actions is a lot more flexible than RubyCI, which means that it’s also a lot more fiddly to set
                up. There are a few resouces out there which make it simpler, but I coudn’t find any that completely
                addressed the setup I was looking for. I did use Matt Swanson’s Boring Rails guide as a starting point
                but made some fairly substantial changes. It’s also worth taking a look at the official documentation.
                Some useful bookmarks:</p>

            </ul>
                <p>
                The biggest changes was led by the discovery or ReviewDog, which provides a way to post review comments
                back on the commit or pull request in GitHub, I was somewhat surprised that GitHub actions didn’t
                support this out of the box, considering it’s part of the same platform, I thought posting comments back
                on the code would be simple, maybe I missed it? Either way reviewdog handles that for you, and appears
                to be well used and well supported.
                <br><br>

                I found it easiest to do the intial setup using the GitHub web UI, when you do this GitHub automatically
                creates a .github/workflows directory in your project root and the commit to be able to store it.
                <br><br>

                These workflow files are each what you could consider an “action”. They’re YAML files which tell the
                GitHub runner what to do. I created two workflows, one to run all of my code quality and security checks
                and the other to to run tests. Both of these workflows use a RAILS_MASTER_KEY environment variable which
                is stored in the GitHub repo secrets. You can view them both in this gist, and I’ll include them at the
                end of the post.
                <br><br>

                The code quality action runs on every push and when a pull request is made to our default branch. It
                then checks out the code, installs ruby and gems then runs Bundler Audit, Brakeman and Rubocop. Rubocop
                is actually down twice, once to run on every push and the other runs on pull requests. This is the only
                way I could configure it to report a green tick and also add comments to a pull request against any
                failure.
                <br><br>

                The test workflow is a bit more complicated as it has to setup the application to run the tests. It runs
                on pushes to main, pull requests to main, as well as on workflow dispatch (manually from GitHub web) and
                on a weekly schedule. Before the rails setup setup, we have to setup Postgres and Redis services. The
                GitHub docs for setting these up are great. We then repeat the steps to checkout our code and install
                dependencies. The final steps load our database schema, run the tests, and upload our code coverage to
                CodeCov (which requires an additional secret).
                <br><br>

                Once these workflows have each run once, you can add them to a branch protection rule in GitHub. This is
                done in your repo’s Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules > edit > Require status checks to pass
                before merging > search for the name of the job.
                <br><br>

                I hope this is enough for you to migrate to GitHub applications. If I’ve missed anything or you think
                there is anything I should add, please let me know!</p>
